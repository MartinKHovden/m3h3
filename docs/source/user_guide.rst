User guide
===========

This user guide gives an introduction on how to do simulations using m3h3. It 
starts of with giving an step by step guide of the different problems that can be solved
using m3h3, before it show how m3h3 can be set up to simulate a system where
the different mechanics interact with each other. For now only the electro 
physiologoly module is implemented.  

For now, only the electro physiologoly module is implemented. The guide should be updated
when m3h3 is updated to run simulations for the other problems as well. 

For a more detailed overview of the different classes and function in m3h3, see the API 
reference.
